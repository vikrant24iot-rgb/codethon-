                            <p><strong>A:</strong> Public Wi-Fi is often unsecured, so never use it for sensitive activities like online banking or shopping. When connecting, make sure your device's firewall is on and consider using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to encrypt your data.</p>

                            <p><strong>A:</strong> Review your privacy settings on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook. Be mindful of what you postâ€”avoid sharing real-time information about your location or specific schedules. Remember that what you share with a small group of friends can still be seen by many people.</p>

                            <p><strong>A:</strong> Social engineering is a way for cybercriminals to trick people into giving them personal information. This could be a fake email from the "IT department" asking for your password or a text message offering a free gift card if you click a link. Always be suspicious of unexpected requests for information, and never share your passwords.</p>

                            <p><strong>A:</strong> A strong password is your first line of defense. Instead of using a single word, try creating a "passphrase" by combining four or more random words, like <strong>PurpleTableCorrectHorse</strong>. This makes it long and complex, but still memorable.</p>

                            <p><strong>A:</strong> Spear phishing emails are highly personalized. Be suspicious of emails that create a sense of urgency, request unusual wire transfers, or ask for your login credentials. Always verify requests through a separate channel, like a phone call, before acting.</p>

                            <p><strong>A:</strong> No, these can be a security risk. Public charging stations are susceptible to "juice jacking," where malware can be installed on your device. Always use a wall outlet with your own charger or carry a portable power bank.</p>

                            <p><strong>A:</strong> A <strong>man-in-the-middle</strong> attack happens when a hacker intercepts communication between your device and a server.

                            <p><strong>A:</strong> First, try to regain control of your account by using the "forgot password" or "account recovery" feature. Inform your friends and family on a different platform (like text or phone call) that your account has been compromised and they should ignore any messages from it. Report the hack to the social media platform's support team.</p>

                            <p><strong>A:</strong> <strong>Ransomware</strong> is malicious software that locks up your files and demands a payment to unlock them. To protect against it, back up all your important files regularly to an external hard drive or a secure cloud service. This way, if you are attacked, you won't have to pay the ransom to get your data back.</p>

                            <p><strong>A:</strong> This is a very common "grandparent scam." A hacker may have taken over your grandchild's account. Do not send any money. Call your grandchild directly on a number you know is theirs to verify the request. Never rely solely on social media messages for such requests.</p>

                            <p><strong>A:</strong> This is a classic "tech support scam." Legitimate companies like Microsoft will never call you out of the blue to fix a problem. Hang up immediately. Do not give them remote access to your computer or your personal information.</p>

                            <p><strong>A:</strong> The safest way is to use a password manager. If you're not comfortable with that, write them down in a notebook and keep it in a secure, private place, like a locked drawer. Never save passwords in a document on your computer or phone, or on a sticky note.</p>
