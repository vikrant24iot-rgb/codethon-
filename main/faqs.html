            <h2>General Cyber Safety</h2>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">What is "cyber safety" and why is it important for me?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Cyber safety is the practice of protecting yourself and your information online. It's crucial because so much of our lives—from banking and shopping to socializing and working—happens in the digital world. Being cyber-safe helps prevent identity theft, financial loss, and personal data breaches.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">Is my home Wi-Fi secure? How can I check?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Your Wi-Fi network's security depends on a few factors. You can check by looking at your router's security settings (WPA3 is the latest and most secure). Always change the default password, create a strong, unique one, and consider using a guest network for visitors.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">I use a public Wi-Fi network at a coffee shop or airport. Is that safe?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Public Wi-Fi is generally not secure. Avoid accessing sensitive information like online banking or shopping while on a public network. If you must, use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your data.</p>

            <h2>Passwords and Accounts</h2>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">What's the best way to create a strong password?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">A strong password is long, unique, and complex. Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The best approach is to create a passphrase—a series of random words—that is easy for you to remember but hard for a computer to guess.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">Is it okay to use the same password for multiple accounts?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">No, this is a major security risk. If one account is compromised, a hacker could gain access to all of your other accounts that use the same password. Use a password manager to securely store and generate unique passwords for all your logins.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">What is a password manager, and do I need one?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">A password manager is an application that securely stores all your passwords in an encrypted "vault." You only need to remember one master password to unlock it. Yes, using one is highly recommended to manage complex and unique passwords without having to memorize them all.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">What is two-factor authentication (2FA), and should I enable it?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">2FA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts. After entering your password, you'll need to provide a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone or generated by an app. You should enable 2FA on every account that offers it, especially for email, banking, and social media.</p>

            <h2>Phishing and Scams</h2>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">I received a suspicious email/text message. How can I tell if it's a scam?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Look for warning signs like urgent or threatening language, spelling and grammar errors, and requests for personal information. Check the sender's email address to see if it's from a legitimate domain. Never click on links or download attachments from suspicious sources.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">What should I do if I think I've been a victim of a phishing scam?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Immediately change your password for the compromised account. Enable two-factor authentication. Report the scam email or message to your email provider. If you entered financial information, contact your bank or credit card company immediately.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">What are common types of online scams I should watch out for?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Common scams include phishing emails, tech support scams (where someone pretends to be from a major company and asks for remote access to your computer), fake prize or lottery scams, and romance scams.</p>

            <h2>Social Media and Privacy</h2>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">I'm concerned about my privacy on social media. What can I do?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Review your privacy settings on all social media platforms. Limit who can see your posts and personal information. Avoid oversharing details like your home address, travel plans, or full birth date. Think before you post—what you put online can be there forever.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">Is it safe to click on every link my friends post on social media?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Not necessarily. A friend's account could be hacked or they might unknowingly share a malicious link. If a link seems unusual or too good to be true, it's best to verify it with your friend before clicking.</p>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h2>Device Security</h2>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">Should I install antivirus software on my computer and smartphone?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes. Antivirus software helps protect your devices from malware, viruses, and other malicious threats. While modern operating systems have built-in defenses, a reputable antivirus program adds a valuable layer of protection.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">How often should I update my software and apps?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">You should update your software and apps as soon as new updates are available. These updates often include critical security patches that fix vulnerabilities and protect you from new threats.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">Is it safe to charge my phone at a public USB port?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">No, this is not safe. Public USB charging ports can be tampered with to install malware on your device or steal your data in a process known as "juice jacking." It's safer to use your own wall charger or a portable power bank.</p>
